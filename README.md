# coda (covid-19 data for all)

A large amount of scientific literature (reports, articles, case studies) and data regarding COVID-19 is already available – for example, browse COVID-19 Pandemic in Europe, WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, Coronavirus @ Worldometer, medRxiv, BMJ's Coronavirus Hub, COVID-19 Open Data. Create a "smart" (micro-)service-based Web system able to provide for both specialists and general public support for studying, visualizing, annotating, augmenting, and sharing – in multiple formats – the most authoritative and useful knowledge about this disease, including important advices, regional statistics, evolution & prediction. Implement at least three of the enumerated services. All processed data/knowledge will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint – a useful ontology: CIDO (Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology). Inspiration: A knowledge-graph platform for newsrooms. Additional resources: COVID-19 Developer Resource Center. Bonus: capturing and exposing useful provenance.
