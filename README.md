# CODA (covid-19 data for all)

**CODA** stands for COVID-19 Data for All. It is a smart micro-service-based application that is able to provide information regarding the Covid-19 pandemic in multiple written and visual formats for both specialists and the general public. CODAâ€™s goal is to keep everyone informed about the pandemic in a fast and easy manner and avoid spreading misinformation to the general public.

### CODA REST API
CODA offers a public [REST API](https://coda-apiv1.herokuapp.com/api/news/latest)  providing access to all the data available on the website.
The data can be queried, filtered and downloaded (in both JSON and CSV format). 
For detailed instructions on how to use it, please refer to the [user guide](https://github.com/teodoragrosu/WADe-Project/blob/main/Documentation/Scholarly%20Report/User%20Guide.html).
The Swagger documentation is openly available [here](https://coda-documentation.herokuapp.com/ui/) and the Open API Specification documentation resides at [this address](https://coda-documentation.herokuapp.com/openapi.json).

### Technical Documentation
CODA is a microservice-based application, that uses GraphDB as a database and SPARQL to retrieve the data. The full technical documentation is available [on github](https://github.com/teodoragrosu/WADe-Project/blob/main/Documentation/Scholarly%20Report/CODA-documentation.html). 
A detailed overview of the vocabularies used to model the data can be found [on this page](https://github.com/teodoragrosu/WADe-Project/wiki/Vocabularies).
